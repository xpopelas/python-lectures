# Setup

In this lecture, we are primarily going to focus on the setup and everything you need to get started.

No coding is yet expected of you, so don't worry;) We will get to that in the next lecture.

## What is Python?

Python is a programming language that is used for a wide variety of purposes. It is a general-purpose language, which means that it can be used for almost anything. It is used for web development, data science, machine learning, and much more.

## Why Python?

Python is a very popular language, and it is used by many companies. It is also a very beginner-friendly language, which makes it a great language to start with.

## How to install Python?

To install Python, you can go to the official website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

From there, you can download the latest version of Python. Make sure to download the version that is compatible with your operating system.

## How to actually start with writing of Python?

There are two ways to write Python code. You can either use a text editor or an IDE (Integrated Development Environment).

To actually make it easier for you and to make sure that you have everything you need, I recommend you to use an IDE. The IDE that I recommend is PyCharm. You can download it from here: [https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/).

**TIP**: Since you most likely don't want to pay for PyCharm, you can download the Community Edition. It is free and it has everything you need. To find the download link, just scroll down a bit on the page.

# Verify setup

To verify that the setup was successful, you can open PyCharm and create a new project. You can name it whatever you want.

Then, you can create a new Python file. You can name it whatever you want as well.

After you've created the file, you can just copy the code in file called `example.py`. You can find it in the `01` folder.

Then, you can run the code by clicking on a small green arrow right next to statement `if __name__ == "__main__":`. If everything was successful, you should see the output in the block below the code.

You can also try to read through the code and try to understand what it does. It is of course not necessary to understand it right now, but it is a good practice to find out what it might do.

# Homework

Your homework for now is to only go through the steps above and make sure that you have everything set up. If you have any problems, feel free to contact me and I will try to help you:)

# Next lecture

In the next lecture, we will start with the actual coding. We will start with the basics of programming as well as Python, and we will learn about variables, data types, and much more.

If you're feeling extra hasty and want to learn ahead, I would recommend you to look for some tutorials on YouTube. There are many great tutorials out there on YouTube, and you can learn a lot from them.
These videos are however usually long (around 1 hour), so if you don't have that much time, I would recommend you to wait for the next lecture:)

# Additional resources

- If you decide that you'd like to watch a video on Python for beginners, I would recommend a video from YouTube channel [Programming with Mosh called Python for Beginners - Learn Python in 1 hour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqtD5dpn9C8).
- Additionally, if you decide to try some small coding or adjustments, it's highly likely you will run into some issues. For this, I would greatly recommend you to use Google. 
- If googling and looking for correct answers is not really for you, you can try to use [Phind](https://www.phind.com/). Phind is an AI powered tool for coding, which is overall able to explain a lot of things and help you figure out what might be wrong. It's not necessarily always right, but most of the time it is very usable.
- Last but not least, if you'd like to practice some coding and problem-solving, I would recommend you to try [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/). It is a website where you can solve coding challenges and practice your coding skills. It is a great way to practice and learn new things, and it is also a great way to get better at problem-solving.
